<h4>Why doesn't it work?</h4>
<p>It's like proto-alpha, so things will break, go missing or just plain not work. But they should work, so drop us a line at tim at geothings dot net and it will be looked at.</p>

<h4>Why can't I use google maps?</h4>
<p>This application is designed for use with the openstreetmap project. There are legal and ethical arguments not to use Google Maps when rectifiying and processing out of copyright maps.</p>

<h4>WMS & JOSM</h4>

<p>grab the wms link and paste that into the relevant place using the wmsplugin. Have a look on the openstreetmap wiki for more info.</p>

<h4>Can I get the code and help?</h4>
<p>Yes. you can get the code here: http://svn2.geothings.net/warper/ it's MIT licenced<br />
. You can contact me, Tim Waters, in OFTC #osm, as chippy. or by mail at tim splat geothings dot net</p>

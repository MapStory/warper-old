Some things you may need to set up first:

Mapserver: used when showing warped map. Mapserv renamed to mapserv.cgi living in (or linked to)the cgi-bin directory. You'd need to have your own mapserv executable on hand to use for this. FWTOOLS is ok to use for this.

config/deploy.rb for capistrano users, change this as fits. Have a look and see how it works with shared paths, to save mapserver map files and images between deploys.

gdal - needs to be installed, again FWTOOLS good. the path to the gdal executable directory can be added / changed in config/environments/production.rb and development.rb .If the system is not on the PATH.

database - standard rails db migrate should do the trick - mysql or sqlite3 should be fine. Change the database.example file to your database.yml 

rmagic gem is needed also, for thumbnails and image handling, using attachment_fu plugin. (imagemagick is required for rmagic)
